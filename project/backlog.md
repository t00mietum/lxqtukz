- Paste randomly stops working in terminals. QTerminal and SilkTerm. (Critical.)
	- ID: 2026101417551800
	- Type: Bug
	- Status: Done
	- Needs local test suite run?: Done 20261015.
	- Priority|Severity: Critical
	- Opened: 20261014-175518
	- Opened by: t00mietum
	- Test environment: Debian 13, the stock LXQt session on Wayfire 0.9.0 (wlroots 0.18), Qt 6.8.
	- Reproduced: Yes, 20261014, both causes below, on Debian's Wayfire 0.9 headless in the test container. Same packages as this box.
	- Actual cause:
		- QTerminal: since Wayfire 0.9 a context menu takes keyboard focus, and Qt's menu Paste then pastes nothing that another app copied. Ctrl+Shift+V works. Wayfire issue 2600.
		- SilkTerm: its window is Wayland, but it copies and pastes through the X11 clipboard. wlroots only lets X11 apps use the clipboard while an X11 window has focus. So a copy in SilkTerm never reaches other apps, and SilkTerm pastes nothing another app copied. This box has no X11 windows open at all.
	- Progress log:
		- 20261014: ruled out on this box: no clipboard manager or other clipboard watcher runs. KDE Connect runs but has no paired device, so its clipboard plugin isn't loaded. The session log has nothing about the clipboard.
		- 20261014: to confirm on this box with no changes: copy in FeatherPad, then right-click Paste in QTerminal pastes nothing, while Ctrl+Shift+V works. Copy in SilkTerm, then `wl-paste` in QTerminal prints the older text. Nothing in the live config fixes the first on Wayfire 0.9. The option starts at 0.10.
		- 20261014: question: the SilkTerm half can be fixed in SilkTerm, by using the Wayland clipboard when its window is on Wayland. That's the clean fix, but it's SilkTerm's. Or LXQtukz could lift wlroots' rule, with a wlroots patch or a clipboard bridge in the session. Either lets any X11 app read the clipboard at any time, as on X11. Which way?
	- Related IDs: 2026101422570842, 2026101509021629
	- Decisions:
		- 20261015: the SilkTerm half gets fixed in SilkTerm. LXQtukz also gets a clipboard bridge, from tukzclip, a separate project. Its item moved to that project's backlog.
	- Actual fix [Bug]: QTerminal half: the Wayfire config each release comes with turns on `focus_main_surface_instead_of_popup`, as a patch to upstream's file. SilkTerm half: fixed in SilkTerm, and the bridge comes from tukzclip.
	- Branch: pastefix
	- Commit: c230370
	- Test case: `cicd/paste.bash` menu stage for the QTerminal half. It fails on Debian's Wayfire 0.9 (`--system`), and with the option off. Its xwayland stage is the SilkTerm half, and fails today.
	- Swept: the Wayfire option covers context-menu paste in every Qt app, QTerminal included. Of the apps running on this box, only SilkTerm has an X11 clipboard connection.
	- Verified: 20261015, `cicd/paste.bash menu` on the release build passes, and fails with the option off. The xwayland stage still fails, as expected, until SilkTerm and tukzclip have their fixes.
	- Closed: 20261015-161500
	- Acceptance signoff: Self-closed: the QTerminal half's test passes, and the SilkTerm half went to SilkTerm and tukzclip per the decision.

- Milestone 3 - All settings in one place
	- ID: 2026101221490202

- Start work on a unified settings application, ala KDE. This will be our own, we'll eventually remove all other individual OS & desktop settings applications.
	- ID: 2026101412285000
	- Type: Feature
	- Status: Started
	- Opened: 20261014-122850
	- Opened by: t00mietum
	- Parent ID: 2026101221490202
	- Requirements:
		- Our desktop app (for icons and wallpaper management), 'tukzdesk' will have its own settings app, which we'll remove, and use its exposed API from this new settings app.
	- Baseline design: `design_docs/20260930-145721_settings-dialog.md`, adapted from silkterm. Tabs will be on the left.
	- Progress log:
		- 20261014: started as `lxqtukz-settings` in `source/settings/`. Rust, with a Qt Quick interface through cxx-qt, drawn in the desktop's Qt style. Its tabs and rows come from a shcl file built into it.
		- 20261014: `cicd/settings.bash` checks it, and runs it from the keyboard on a Wayfire in the test container. The release build includes it.

- Settings, implement in order of priority:

	- Parent ID: 2026101221490202
	- Related IDs: 2026101513313865
	- Requirements:
		- Need a screensaver manager and screen power management app. Something simple and intuitive, like XFCE4's, but integrated into the settings app.
		- Keyboard settings (delay, speed, shortcuts). Like XFCE4's, but integrated into the settings app.
		- Mouse settings. Like XFCE4's, but integrated into the settings app.
	- Progress log:
		- 20261014: a first cut of all 3, through Wayfire's own settings. Screen off and Wayfire's cube screensaver with their timeouts, key repeat, layouts and Num Lock, and the mouse and touchpad. Still to do: a lock screen, power actions and keyboard shortcuts.
		- 20261014: labels were unreadable under a dark theme. Fixed.
		- 20261014: a "Test now" icon on screen off and the screensaver, and a test area for key repeat.
		- 20261014: the tallest tab's last row was cut off when the window opened. Fixed.
		- 20261015: the lock screen is gtklock, through LXQt's lock command (`lxqtukz-lock`, item 2026101513313865). The idle lock is a swayidle line in `wayfire.ini`'s `[autostart]`, at 60 minutes, so a lock screen row would edit that line.

- The screen is locked, only shows a green circle, won't accept my password (and has no box for feedback), and I can't tell what user it thinks is logged in. (Critical, pre-next-cut.)
	- ID: 2026101513313865
	- Type: Bug
	- Status: Waiting for testing
	- Needs local test suite run?: Yes. A full `cicd/build.bash` from clean, then `cicd/session.bash` on its release.
	- Needs external testing: A real login on Debian, as tukztest: the user name shows, the right password unlocks, the idle lock after an hour, and the lock before suspend. On NixOS, the first build and a login (milestone 2).
	- Priority|Severity: Critical
	- Opened: 20261015-133138
	- Opened by: t00mietum
	- Related IDs: 2026101412285001
	- Test environment: this box, the stock LXQt session on Wayfire 0.9.0. The locker is swaylock 1.8.2, started by swayidle after 60 minutes idle. It was put in as a stopgap until the move to XFCE.
	- Reproduced: Yes, 20261015, on the release build, headless in the test container. The lock key ran `lxqt-leave --lockscreen`, which then waited forever and locked nothing. Nothing locked when idle.
	- Possible cause: swaylock with default options shows a blank screen. A ring shows only while typing: green as keys go in, blue while checking, red when wrong. There's no password box, no user name and no message, so a typo or a Caps Lock or layout problem looks the same as a hang.
	- Progress log:
		- 20261015: swaylock is running and holds both screens. Only one password try reached PAM, at 12:46, and it was rejected as a wrong password. The ZFS home unlock step after it never ran.
		- 20261015: sending swaylock SIGUSR1 unlocks the screen, per its man page. Not tried yet.
		- 20261015: the LXQtukz lock screen in the Settings item isn't done yet. It needs a password box, the user name, and a message on a failed try.
		- 20261015: the password worked when typed more carefully. So unlocking works, and the bug is the missing feedback.
		- 20261015: this box's own session is XFCE now, and the swaylock stopgap was only in the live config, never in the release. What's left is what LXQtukz itself locks with.
		- 20261015: Wayfire 0.11's session-lock plugin is ext-session-lock-v1, which gtklock 4 needs. Our build has it.
		- 20261015: gtklock shows a password box, "Login failed" for a wrong password, a Caps Lock warning, and with its userinfo module the user name. The name comes from AccountsService, so the headless check can't show it; it only checks that the module loads.
		- 20261015: `gtklock -d` gives up waiting after 1 second. If locking is slower than that, the screen still locks, but LXQt shows an error box after the unlock. Headless it took about half a second.
		- 20261015: for signoff: the idle lock is swayidle after 60 minutes, the same as Wayfire's default screensaver time. The Settings app's screensaver timeout doesn't move it yet.
	- Actual cause: the release sets no locker. Upstream leaves LXQt's Wayland lock command empty, and the swayidle line in upstream's `wayfire.ini` is commented out. So the lock key did nothing and the session never locked when idle. The swaylock seen on this box was a stopgap in the live config with default options, which show no feedback.
	- Decisions:
		- 20261015: LXQtukz's locker is gtklock, since it has to work on both Debian 13 (gtklock 4.0.0 in trixie) and NixOS (nixpkgs has gtklock).
	- Actual fix [Bug]: the release's `session.conf` sets LXQt's Wayland lock command to the new `lxqtukz-lock`, which runs gtklock with a `gtklock.ini` from the usual settings areas, and does nothing if the screen is already locked. A patch to upstream's `wayfire.ini` starts swayidle, which locks after an hour idle. The Debian deps list adds gtklock, its userinfo module, AccountsService, the SVG loader its icons need, swayidle and procps. The NixOS module adds gtklock, swayidle, gtklock's PAM service, AccountsService and a `gtklock.ini` with the module's store path.
	- Branch: gtklock
	- Commit: e39c62b
	- Test case: `cicd/session.bash`, its Lock screen checks. They fail on the release built before the fix: no swayidle, no gtklock, and lxqt-leave left waiting. They pass after. Taking out the already-locked guard, or skipping the wrong password, turns them red.
	- Verified: headless in the test container, on a release staged from this branch: the lock key locks in about half a second, the lock screen shows the password box, a wrong password shows "Login failed" and stays locked, and locking again while locked is quiet. The NixOS module evaluates, with gtklock 4.0.0, swayidle 1.9.0, the PAM service and the module path.
	- Swept: every LXQt way to lock goes through the one lock command: lxqt-leave (lock key, leave dialog, panel), lxqt-session (before sleep, logind's lock), lxqt-runner, and lxqt-powermanagement's idle action. lxqt-globalkeys' Ctrl+Alt+L and xscreensaver are X11-only and don't start in this session.

- The backlight helper's polkit action is in the prefix, where polkit never reads it. Brightness keys may ask for an admin password.
	- ID: 2026101421433387
	- Type: Bug
	- Status: Waiting for testing
	- Needs local test suite run?: A full `cicd/build.bash` from clean, then `cicd/installer.bash` and `cicd/session.bash` on the release it makes.
	- Needs external testing: A real login on this box after the next install. Brightness keys and the brightness settings change the backlight with no password prompt, and Debian's own LXQt session still does too.
	- Priority|Severity: Avg
	- Opened: 20261014-214333

	- Parent ID: 2026101221490200
	- Related IDs: 2026101221490206
	- Note: polkit only reads `/usr/share/polkit-1/actions`, so the installer would link it there. Its action id is the same as Debian's liblxqt one, so it needs its own file name and id first. Unverified that the password prompt happens.
	- Reproduced: Yes, 20261015, on Debian 13's polkit 126. pkexec on our helper finds no action for it and falls back to polkit's generic one, which asks for an admin password. With our action linked under its upstream id, Debian's helper got the generic one instead, since polkit keeps only one action per id.
	- Actual cause: polkit reads actions only from its own dirs, never the prefix. And linked as it was, our action would replace a distro LXQt's, since both have the same id.
	- Actual fix: the release renames the action to `org.lxqtukz.backlight-<version>`, in a file of the same name. The installer links every installed version's action into `/usr/share/polkit-1/actions`, so a session still on an older version keeps working after an update. Prune and uninstall remove the links, and a file that isn't our link is never replaced. NixOS needs nothing new: the module puts the package in the system packages, and polkit reads actions from there.
	- Note: polkit 126 also reads `/usr/local/share/polkit-1/actions`, but missed links made there while that dir was new. So the links go in `/usr/share`.
	- Branch: relfixes
	- Commit: bd44d52
	- Test case: `cicd/installer.bash`, its polkit checks. They fail with the installer and release from before the fix: no link, and pkexec falls back to the generic action. They pass after. A release with the upstream id fails 4 of them, and linking every action without the name check fails 2.
	- Verified: 20261015, `cicd/installer.bash` passed on a release staged from this branch. pkexec picks our action for the helper the session runs, and an active session needs no password for it. Debian's helper keeps its own action. A session on an older version keeps its action after an update. Prune and uninstall leave no link behind.
	- Verified: 20261015, the NixOS module evaluates with polkit on and the system packages' `share/polkit-1` linked. nixpkgs' liblxqt runs the helper by its full path, which matches the action. Not built.
	- Swept: the action is the only polkit file in the prefix. The installer's other links into system dirs go away on uninstall too, and `cicd/installer.bash` checks that no link into `/opt/lxqtukz` is left anywhere.

- CI/CD dogfood: copy each build to its final install location on this box, not to a synced app folder, since this is the only test machine. The settings app already goes to `~/.local/bin`.
	- ID: 2026101418583700
	- Type: Task
	- Status: Waiting for testing
	- Needs local test suite run?: A real `cicd/build.bash dogfood` on this box. It needs sudo, and the full build takes a while.
	- Progress log:
		- 20261015: done by hand once. LXQtukz reinstalled in `/opt/lxqtukz` from the 14:24 build, and `cicd/settings.bash dogfood` put the settings app in `~/.local/bin`. The pipeline step itself is still to do.
		- 20261015: `cicd/build.bash dogfood` does a full build, then installs it with `install.bash -y --from`. The same version as the installed one gets `lxqtukz-update --uninstall -y` first. Any other version installs over it. It skips the reinstall while a session runs that version. The settings app stays with `cicd/settings.bash dogfood`.

	- Decisions:
		- Off unless named, since it needs sudo. Refused with a component list or `--here`, since only a full build writes a release, and `--here` builds straight into `/opt/lxqtukz`.
	- Verified: 20261015, `cicd/tooling.bash dogfood` passes, with sudo, docker, the installer and the updater stubbed. It checks the command order for not installed, same version, other version, same version in use, and no `lxqtukz-update` on PATH. Also no install after a failed build, and the refusals. With the uninstall line taken out, the same-version check fails.
	- Test case: `cicd/tooling.bash dogfood`.

	- Note: tukzedo's own apps, such as silkterm, captain-nemo, the desktop layer and maybe a panel, aren't Qt. Kvantum alone can no longer style a personality.
	- Generated from it: the Kvantum style for other Qt apps, a GTK theme, the style for tukzedo's own apps, silkterm's colors and fonts, and Wayfire's window decorations.
	- Note: try the Rust toolkit for captain-nemo and any panel against 2 very different personalities, such as Windows XP and macOS, before writing much of either.
	- Note: the personalities item itself is in the tukzedo-linux backlog.

- Decide on the rest of the LXQt apps: lximage-qt, lxqt-archiver, screengrab, lxqt-openssh-askpass and lxqt-admin.

- `cicd/upstream.bash`: `status --fetch` to update mirrors before comparing, and a 1-line summary for the merge gate.

	- Opened: 20261012-214902
	- Opened by: t00mietum
	- Progress log:
		- 20261015: `status` reads the newest tag from the mirror, so it's offline and as new as the last fetch. With no mirror it still asks upstream. `--fetch` fetches first. A summary line ends the table, and `--summary` prints only that line. The gate itself is 2026101221490220.
	- Decisions:
		- The summary is informational: `status` still exits 0 when components are behind or a work tree changed. The gate decides what fails.
	- Verified: 20261015, on the real mirrors with no fetch, the table matches the old script's line for line, through libxkbcommon and the rest. `cicd/tooling.bash upstream` passes on local mirrors: a new upstream tag shows only after `--fetch`, prefixed tags and pre-releases, "?" for a component with no matching tag, the no-mirror fallback, and `--fetch` refused for other subcommands. It fails on the old script, with `--fetch` ignored, and with the tag prefix dropped as before 2026101513523151.

- With `AUTO_UPDATE=no`, installing deletes the updater timer's link in `/etc/systemd/system`, so turning auto update on later finds no timer.
	- ID: 2026101509181633
	- Type: Bug
	- Status: Waiting for testing
	- Needs external testing: The next install on this box, which has `AUTO_UPDATE=no`. Both unit links stay, and `systemctl enable --now lxqtukz-update.timer` works afterward.
	- Priority|Severity: Low
	- Opened: 20261015-091816
	- Opened by: t00mietum
	- Reproduced: Yes, 20261015, installing 0.1.0-alpha1 on this box. The service's link is there, the timer's isn't.
	- Possible cause: `systemctl disable` on a linked unit removes the link itself.
	- Actual cause: confirmed. `systemctl disable` removes a linked unit's own link along with its enable links, and the installer disabled the timer right after linking it.
	- Actual fix: with `AUTO_UPDATE=no`, the installer disables the timer first and links both units after.
	- Branch: relfixes
	- Commit: bd44d52
	- Test case: `cicd/installer.bash`, its timer checks. They fail with the old installer: the timer's link is gone, and enabling it says the unit doesn't exist. They pass after.
	- Verified: 20261015, `cicd/installer.bash`, with unit links made offline: both units stay linked through installs and an update with `AUTO_UPDATE=no`, the timer can be enabled afterward, and the next install turns it off again. Not tried against a running systemd.
	- Swept: the only other `systemctl disable` is in `--uninstall`, which removes both links anyway.

- Release manifests say the commit is `unknown`. Inside the build container, git refuses the repo, since it belongs to another user.

	- Reproduced: Yes, 20261014. `git rev-parse HEAD` as root in the build image, on the mounted repo, exits 128 with "dubious ownership".
	- Possible cause: `cicd/build.bash` asks git for the commit inside the container. The host side could pass it in.
	- Actual cause: confirmed. Also, in a worktree the repo's `.git` points outside what the container sees.
	- Actual fix: `cicd/build.bash` reads the commit on the host and passes it into the container. `--here` still asks git itself.
	- Branch: relfixes
	- Commit: bd44d52
	- Test case: `cicd/session.bash`, "the manifest names the commit". It fails on the release built before the fix, which says `unknown`, and passes after.
	- Verified: 20261015, a partial build from this branch wrote the branch's commit into the manifest, with `-dirty` for the uncommitted tree. `cicd/session.bash` passed the check on a release staged from it.
	- Swept: `cicd/build.bash` is the only place a Debian manifest gets its commit. The Nix build takes it from the flake.
	- Acceptance signoff: Self-closed: intent clear, and the test fails before the fix and passes after.

- Wayfire logs that it can't load its fisheye plugin. Upstream's `lxqt-wayfire.ini` turns it on, but fisheye is in wayfire-plugins-extra, which isn't built.

	- Opened: 20261014-214333
	- Opened by: t00mietum
	- Parent ID: 2026101221490200
	- Reproduced: Yes, 20261014, in the session check's Wayfire log. The `[fisheye]` binding does nothing.
	- Possible fix: build wayfire-plugins-extra as a component, or drop fisheye from the release's plugin list.
	- Decisions:
		- 20261015: fisheye is dropped from the release's plugin list, rather than building wayfire-plugins-extra. It's a patch to upstream's `wayfire.ini`, like the paste fix and the idle lock.
	- Actual cause: upstream's `lxqt-wayfire.ini` lists fisheye, which is in wayfire-plugins-extra, and that isn't built.
	- Actual fix: a third lxqt-wayland-session patch takes fisheye out of the plugin list, with its `[fisheye]` binding. Staging a release now fails if any plugin in that list isn't in the prefix.
	- Branch: relfixes
	- Commit: bd44d52
	- Test case: the plugin check in `cicd/utility/stage-prefix.bash`, and "Wayfire loads every plugin in its list" in `cicd/session.bash`. Both fail without the patch, naming fisheye, and pass with it.
	- Verified: 20261015, a partial build of lxqt-wayland-session stopped at staging without the patch and passed with it. `cicd/session.bash` passed every check on a release staged from this branch.
	- Swept: the new check walks the whole plugin list, and every other plugin in it is in the prefix. The settings app has no fisheye row.
	- Note: a user's own `wayfire.ini`, copied at first login, still lists fisheye.
	- Acceptance signoff: Self-closed: follows the 20261015 decision, and the tests fail before the fix and pass after.

- `cicd/paste.bash menu` passes without running either arm on Wayfire 0.11. Its IPC gives window geometry as floats, and the stage's arithmetic stops on them with exit 0.

	- Priority|Severity: High
	- Opened: 20261014-225708
	- Opened by: t00mietum
	- Related IDs: 2026101417551800
	- Note: with the floats truncated, both arms ran against the release build: pasted nothing with the workaround off, and pasted with the release settings.
	- Actual cause [Bug]: bash arithmetic on "100.0" drops the whole stage loop, then runs on to "done" and exit 0.
	- Actual fix [Bug]: the geometry helper prints whole numbers. In paste.bash and settings.bash the stage loop and "done" are one command, so a dropped stage exits 1.
	- Test case: put the floats back and the menu stage exits 1. With the fix, both arms run and it passes. `cicd/settings.bash check build gui keys` passes too.
	- Swept: every `$((` in `cicd/` on outside values reads that one helper.

- `cicd/build.bash <component>` fails when `work/` came from the repo's old location. The source trees are git worktrees that point at their mirror by absolute path.

	- Status: Done
	- Priority|Severity: Low
	- Opened: 20261015-095008
	- Opened by: t00mietum
	- Reproduced: Yes, 20261015. `cicd/build.bash lxqt-build-tools` stopped with "work tree has changes not in the queue", since git couldn't find the worktree under the old path.
	- Note: `git worktree repair`, or relative worktree paths, would cover a moved repo.
	- Actual fix [Bug]: `cicd/upstream.bash` runs `git worktree repair` on any tree whose link points nowhere, before every subcommand.
	- Test case: the old script still fails on this box's trees, and the new one repairs both and applies. liblxqt's tree was only behind its queue, so it was applied again with `--force`.

- Make D-Bus started services use the prefix instead of `/usr`. That covers notifications, the portal and the polkit agent.

	- Status: Done
	- Priority|Severity: Avg
	- Opened: 20261012-214902
	- Opened by: t00mietum
	- Parent ID: 2026101221490200
	- Note: session D-Bus service files may need `XDG_DATA_DIRS` set when the bus starts, or a patch.
	- Related IDs: 2026101221490209
	- Reproduced: Partly, 20261014. In the test container, the bus couldn't start our portal without the fix. That a bus systemd starts before login never looks in the prefix, and that Debian's xdg-desktop-portal runs with the systemd user environment, is from reading only.
	- Actual cause: only the portal is D-Bus started. Notifications and the polkit agent are started by lxqt-session from the prefix's autostart entries, by name, with the prefix first in `PATH`, so they already use the prefix.
	- Actual fix: `startlxqtukz` copies the prefix's D-Bus service files into the bus's runtime dir, which the bus reads on demand, and drops the systemd hand-off from them. It also gives the session's `XDG_DATA_DIRS` and desktop name to D-Bus and systemd, so xdg-desktop-portal finds our portal and its config. The release's `wayfire.ini` hands over the display right before lxqt-session starts, since lxqt-session starts the portal before it hands over its own environment. `xdg-desktop-portal` joined the release's dependency list.
	- Progress log:
		- 20261014: the new session check found the launcher stopped when `LANG` was unset. Fixed.
		- 20261014: the same check found lxqt-session starts the portal before the display is known. The LXQt portal died, and xdg-desktop-portal left the file chooser out for the whole session.
		- 20261015: failed on this box, with 0.1.0-alpha1 installed, in a session as a test user on the systemd user bus. The bus started Debian's `/usr/libexec/xdg-desktop-portal-lxqt`. The bus was up before the launcher wrote its service file, and it only looks again for a name it can't find. Debian's own file has the name, so ours was never read. After a `ReloadConfig` call on the bus, the prefix's portal started. The container has no Debian portal, which is why the check passed there.
		- 20261015: the launcher now asks the bus to reload after writing the files. `cicd/session.bash` starts its bus with a distro copy of the portal's service file in its data dirs, as Debian's LXQt has.
	- Branch: prefixfix, dbusreload
	- Commit: 83f953f, fdc2866
	- Test case: `cicd/session.bash`, its D-Bus and portal checks, with the distro copy in place.
	- Verified: 20261014, `cicd/session.bash` passed its D-Bus and portal checks 3 times in a row, with and without a GPU. With the old launcher 3 of those checks fail, and with the old `session` line the portal check fails.
	- Verified: 20261015, `cicd/session.bash` with the distro copy fails both portal checks with the old launcher and passes with the new one. On this box, with the new launcher installed, a session as the test user on its systemd user bus started the portal from `/opt/lxqtukz`, and xdg-desktop-portal offered the file chooser.

	- Reproduced: Yes, 20261014. The build's check listed libqtxdg's icon engine and lxqt-qtplugin's platform theme in Qt's plugin dir, and liblxqt's polkit action for the backlight helper.
	- Actual cause: all 3 take their install dir from Qt or PolkitQt, not from the prefix. The portal, autostart and systemd files already went to the prefix.
	- Actual fix: configure flags put all 3 under the prefix. lxqt-qtplugin and liblxqt each needed a small patch to accept one. The session already adds the prefix's plugin dir to `QT_PLUGIN_PATH`.
	- Note: the polkit action does nothing from the prefix. Filed as its own item.
	- Branch: prefixfix
	- Commit: 95549c0, fdc2866
	- Test case: the check in `cicd/build.bash` for files outside the prefix. With the new flags moved aside it lists all 3 files; the full build passes it.

	- Actual cause: the container's `/opt` is new on every run, so a partial build's prefix had only the components that run built.
	- Actual fix: the prefix is kept in `work/prefix/` and mounted into the container. A partial build over a prefix that no full build has finished says so, and skips staging.

		- 20261014: pcmanfm-qt 2.4.1 wants a newer layer-shell-qt than Debian 13 has. A patch uses the older API for the same thing.
		- 20261014: Wayfire's bundled wlroots needs newer wayland, wayland-protocols, libdrm, xkbcommon and pixman than Debian 13 has. They're built into the prefix on Debian only.
	- Decisions:
		- 20261014: the newer libraries are built in, rather than pinning an older Wayfire, since the paste fix needs Wayfire 0.11. Recorded in design.md.

## Template

- Notes:

	- Only use rows that you actually need or expect will be filled in. Always fill in the title, ID, Type, Status, Opened and Created by.

	- The ID is the local time to the hundredth of a second. Opened is when it was written down, which may differ. (Use a keyboard macro and possibly something like project 'zuid' to generate.)

	- Status values meaning: Testing means the fix is in and checks are running or still to run. Waiting on signoff means automated testing passed. Moot means something else changed that made it irrelevant. Canceled means it still applies but was decided against. Waiting for testing means the fix is in and waits on a long CI run or an outside test host. Can't reproduce means a real attempt to reproduce it failed.
		- An item with nothing left for a person to judge skips Waiting on signoff and goes straight to Done. `Clean up the backlog` in the directives says when.

	- As issues are worked, and statuses change, place them in correct sorting order within the list:
		- First by status: Waiting for answers, Waiting on signoff, Testing, Waiting for testing, Can't reproduce, Stalled, Started, Queued, Done, Deferred, Canceled, Moot
		- Then by severity|priority: Critical, High, Avg, Low
		- Then by type: Bugs, [not bugs together]

	- Rows marked [Bug] are for bugs only, and rows marked [Feature] for features and enhancements. Priority and Severity share one row and one scale. Priority is for a Feature or Enhancement, and Severity for a Bug. Children are not nested. They sit at the top level and point back with Parent ID.
